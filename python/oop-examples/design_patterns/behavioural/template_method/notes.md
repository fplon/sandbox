The Template Method design pattern aims to define the skeleton of an algorithm in a superclass but allows subclasses to override specific steps of the algorithm without changing its structure. Here's a summary of its purpose, along with pros, cons, and alternative approaches:

### Purpose:

- **Encapsulation of Algorithm Structure:** It encapsulates the overall algorithm structure in the superclass, promoting code reuse and maintenance.
- **Flexibility:** It allows subclasses to provide their own implementations for specific steps of the algorithm, enabling customization while maintaining a consistent structure.
- **Promotes Code Consistency:** By providing a common template for algorithms, it ensures consistency across subclasses, leading to more maintainable codebases.

### Pros:

- **Code Reusability:** The template method promotes reuse of common algorithm structure across multiple subclasses.
- **Customization:** Subclasses can customize specific steps of the algorithm without affecting the overall structure.
- **Maintenance:** Changes to the algorithm can be made in the superclass, affecting all subclasses, thus reducing maintenance efforts.
- **Enforces Design Consistency:** It enforces a consistent design across subclasses, improving code readability and maintainability.

### Cons:

- **Rigid Structure:** The template method imposes a fixed structure on subclasses, which may not always be suitable for all scenarios.
- **Complexity:** Inheritance hierarchies can become complex, especially if multiple levels of inheritance are involved.
- **Violation of Single Responsibility Principle:** The template method may violate the Single Responsibility Principle by combining multiple responsibilities within a single class.

### Alternative Approaches:

- **Strategy Pattern:** Instead of using inheritance, the Strategy pattern employs composition, allowing algorithms to vary independently of the context.
- **Dependency Injection:** Algorithms can be passed as dependencies, allowing different implementations to be injected dynamically.
- **Hook Methods:** Rather than enforcing a fixed structure, hook methods can be provided in the superclass, allowing subclasses to hook in their behavior at specific points.

In summary, the Template Method pattern provides a way to define a reusable algorithm structure while allowing for customization in subclasses. However, it may lead to rigid designs and complexity, and alternative patterns like Strategy or Dependency Injection can offer more flexibility and maintainability in certain situations.

Let's break down the key elements of this implementation (`etl.py`) in relation to the Template Method pattern:

1. **Abstract Class (`ETLTemplate`):**
   - The `ETLTemplate` class serves as the abstract class defining the skeleton of the ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process.
   - It declares the `etl_process()` method as the template method, which defines the overall sequence of steps for the ETL process.
   - Abstract methods `extract_data()` and `transform_data()` are defined within the abstract class, representing steps that must be implemented by concrete subclasses.

2. **Concrete Subclass (`CSVETL`):**
   - `CSVETL` is a concrete subclass that extends the abstract class `ETLTemplate`.
   - It provides concrete implementations for the abstract methods `extract_data()` and `transform_data()`, customizing the behavior for CSV data extraction and transformation.
   - The `load_data()` method is inherited from the abstract class but can be overridden if necessary. In this example, it uses a default implementation for loading transformed data into a CSV file.

3. **Template Method (`etl_process()`):**
   - The `etl_process()` method in the abstract class serves as the template method.
   - It orchestrates the overall ETL process by invoking the abstract methods `extract_data()` and `transform_data()` in a predefined sequence.
   - The template method ensures the consistent execution flow of the ETL process while allowing subclasses to provide custom implementations for specific steps.

4. **Customization Points:**
   - Abstract methods `extract_data()` and `transform_data()` serve as customization points where concrete subclasses can provide their own implementations.
   - Subclasses can extend or override these methods to tailor the behavior according to the specific requirements of different data sources or transformation logic.

Overall, the implementation follows the Template Method pattern by defining a reusable algorithmic structure (in this case, the ETL process) in the abstract class, while allowing subclasses to customize specific steps to accommodate different data sources and transformation requirements. This pattern promotes code reuse, maintainability, and consistency in the implementation of similar processes across different contexts.
