The Strategy Design Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that allows you to define a family of algorithms, encapsulate each one of them, and make them interchangeable.

The key elements of the Strategy Design Pattern implementation are:

1. **Strategy Interface/Protocol**: This defines a protocol or interface that all concrete strategies must adhere to. It outlines the methods that concrete strategies should implement.

2. **Concrete Strategies**: These are the different algorithms or strategies that implement the Strategy interface/protocol. Each concrete strategy provides a specific implementation of the algorithm.

3. **Context**: This is the class that holds a reference to the current strategy object and delegates the algorithm's execution to the strategy object. It abstracts the client from the details of the concrete strategies.

4. **Client**: The client code creates the context object and sets its strategy. It interacts with the context object to execute the algorithm without being aware of the specific strategy being used.

By encapsulating the algorithms in separate concrete strategy classes and allowing them to be interchanged within the context object, the Strategy Design Pattern promotes flexibility, extensibility, and easier maintenance of the codebase.

Certainly! Here are the key features of this implementation as it relates to the Strategy Pattern:

1. **Abstraction of Algorithms**: The Strategy Pattern abstracts algorithms into separate classes (`BuyAndHoldStrategy`, `MomentumTradingStrategy`, `MeanReversionTradingStrategy`), each implementing the `TradingStrategy` interface. This allows for the encapsulation of different trading algorithms.

2. **Interface/Protocol**: The `TradingStrategy` protocol defines a common interface for all concrete strategy classes. It ensures that each strategy class implements the `execute_trade` method, providing a consistent way to execute trades.

3. **Encapsulation and Flexibility**: Each concrete strategy encapsulates a specific trading algorithm along with its parameters. This encapsulation provides flexibility as strategies can be added, modified, or replaced without affecting the client code or other parts of the system.

4. **Dynamic Strategy Selection**: The `TradingSystem` class holds a reference to the current trading strategy (`_trading_strategy`) and provides a method (`set_trading_strategy`) to dynamically switch between different strategies at runtime. This dynamic selection allows the system to adapt to changing market conditions or user preferences without modifying the client code.

5. **Loose Coupling**: The client code interacts with the `TradingSystem` class without needing to know the details of the concrete trading strategies. This loose coupling between the client code and the concrete strategies promotes maintainability and ease of extension.

6. **Parameterized Strategies**: Each concrete strategy accepts additional parameters specific to that strategy (`price`, `momentum`, `mean_price`). This allows for customization and fine-tuning of the trading algorithms, further enhancing flexibility and adaptability.

Overall, this implementation demonstrates the core principles of the Strategy Pattern by providing a flexible and maintainable way to encapsulate, interchange, and parameterize different trading algorithms within a trading system.
