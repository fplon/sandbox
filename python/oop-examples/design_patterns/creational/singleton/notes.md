The Singleton pattern is a design pattern that ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to that instance. In Python, it's commonly used for managing resources that should be shared across the entire application, such as database connections, configuration settings, or in your case, financial data.

Advantages of using the Singleton pattern:
- Resource Management: It helps in efficient management of resources by ensuring that only one instance of a class is created and shared across the application.
- Global Access: It provides a global point of access to the single instance, making it easy to access the shared resources from any part of the code.
- Lazy Initialization: Singleton instances can be lazily initialized, meaning they are only created when they are first needed, improving performance and resource usage.
- Thread Safety: Singleton implementations can be made thread-safe, ensuring safe access to shared resources in multi-threaded environments.

Disadvantages of using the Singleton pattern:
- Global State: It introduces global state into the application, which can make the code harder to test and reason about.
- Hidden Dependencies: Code that depends on singletons may have hidden dependencies, making it difficult to understand and maintain.
- Difficult to Subclass: Singleton classes are often difficult to subclass or extend.

Alternative approaches when coding in Python:
- Dependency Injection: Instead of using singletons, consider using dependency injection to pass dependencies explicitly to the parts of the code that need them. This promotes better testability and decouples the code from global state.
- Factory Pattern: Use the factory pattern to create instances of classes, allowing more flexibility in managing object creation and avoiding the limitations of singletons.
- Module-Level Variables: In Python, module-level variables act as singletons by default. You can organize your code such that shared resources are stored as module-level variables and accessed as needed.
