The Prototype design pattern is not as commonly used in Python as it is in some other languages like Java, where object instantiation is more costly and where cloning objects can provide performance benefits.

In Python, the language's dynamic nature often allows for more straightforward approaches to achieving similar goals. For instance, Python's built-in features like class inheritance, mixins, and metaprogramming can often provide more elegant solutions without explicitly implementing the Prototype pattern.

That said, there are scenarios where the Prototype pattern can still be useful in Python, particularly when dealing with complex object creation or when you need to create new objects with similar properties and behavior efficiently. One such example, as demonstrated earlier, is in managing variations of investment strategies within a financial application.

Additionally, in Python, the Prototype pattern is sometimes used in conjunction with other design patterns or architectural patterns to achieve specific goals. For instance, in combination with the Factory pattern, the Prototype pattern can help manage object creation in a more flexible and scalable manner.

While the Prototype pattern might not be as prevalent in Python as in some other languages, its usage can still be beneficial in certain contexts, especially when designing systems that require efficient object creation and customization.

Most useful when: 
1. Objects are complicated to construct
2. Take long time to create

Using the Prototype Factory pattern compared to a traditional Factory pattern offers several benefits, especially in scenarios like the one described for financial instruments:

1. Reduced overhead in creating objects: The Prototype Factory pattern avoids the overhead of repeatedly creating new objects by allowing you to clone existing instances. In the context of financial instruments, where similar objects with varying parameters are common, this can lead to significant performance improvements.
2. Flexibility in object creation: With the Prototype Factory pattern, you can create new objects by cloning existing prototypes and modifying them as needed. This promotes flexibility and allows for dynamic changes to object properties without modifying the factory or creating new subclasses.
3 .Minimized subclass proliferation: In traditional Factory patterns, you might need to create numerous subclasses to represent different variations of objects. With the Prototype Factory pattern, you can avoid this subclass proliferation by using a few prototype instances and modifying them as necessary.
4. Encapsulation of object creation logic: The Prototype Factory encapsulates the object creation logic within the factory class, making it easier to manage and maintain. It abstracts away the complexities of object creation from the client code, leading to cleaner and more maintainable code.
5. Support for complex object structures: The Prototype Factory pattern is particularly useful when dealing with complex object structures or objects that contain references to other objects. It ensures that the entire object structure is cloned accurately, maintaining the integrity of the original objects.

In summary, while both Factory and Prototype Factory patterns are creational patterns used for object creation, the Prototype Factory pattern offers additional benefits such as reduced overhead, increased flexibility, and better encapsulation, making it particularly suitable for scenarios involving object cloning and customization, such as the creation of financial instruments with varying parameters.
