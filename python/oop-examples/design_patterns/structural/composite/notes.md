Treating individual and aggregated objects uniformly

The Composite pattern is a structural design pattern used in object-oriented programming to compose objects into tree-like structures to represent part-whole hierarchies. This pattern allows clients to treat individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly. 

Here are some advantages of using the Composite pattern:

Simplified Client Code: Clients can interact with individual objects and compositions uniformly, simplifying the client code. They don't need to distinguish between leaf objects and composite objects.
Flexibility and Scalability: The pattern allows for the creation of complex structures by composing simple objects recursively. This provides flexibility and scalability in designing and implementing systems.
Code Reusability: Components can be reused across different structures, promoting code reusability and modular design.
Maintainability: Changes to the structure of composite objects do not affect the client code, promoting code maintainability and reducing coupling.

However, there are some potential disadvantages to consider:

Complexity: Implementing the Composite pattern can introduce complexity, especially when dealing with large and deeply nested structures.
Performance Overhead: Depending on the implementation, there might be some performance overhead associated with traversing composite structures.
Difficulty in Ensuring Type Safety: In languages without strong type systems, ensuring type safety across different types of components can be challenging.

Alternative approaches to the Composite pattern include using simpler design patterns like the Iterator or Visitor pattern, or using functional programming techniques such as recursion.

In Python, the Composite pattern is commonly used, especially in scenarios where hierarchical structures need to be represented and manipulated. Common example use cases in finance could include representing a portfolio composed of individual assets, where both the portfolio and assets share similar behaviors such as valuation and performance tracking.
