An interface for accessing a particular resource

A class that functions as an interface to a particular resource. That resource may be remote, expensive to construct, or may require logging or some other fucntionality.

Proxy vs Decorator:
- Proxy provides an IDENTICAL interface
- Decorator provides an ENHANCED interface


Certainly, here's a breakdown of the Proxy pattern:

1. **Pros**:

    - **Controlled Access**: Proxy allows you to control access to the underlying object. This is useful for implementing access control mechanisms.
    - **Lazy Initialization**: It enables lazy initialization of the real object, meaning the real object is only created when it's actually needed. This can help improve performance and resource utilization.
    - **Additional Functionality**: Proxies can add additional functionality such as logging, caching, access control, or monitoring without modifying the real object's code.
    - **Remote Access**: Proxies can act as a local representative for remote objects, enabling communication with remote resources.

2. **Cons**:

    - **Complexity**: Introducing proxies can increase the complexity of the system, especially if multiple layers of proxies are involved.
    - **Overhead**: Proxies may introduce overhead in terms of memory and processing, particularly if additional functionality is implemented.
    - **Tight Coupling**: Proxies and real objects can become tightly coupled, especially if the proxy needs to mirror the interface of the real object closely.

3. **Common Use Examples**:

    - **Lazy Loading**: Loading of large objects, images, or database connections only when needed.
    - **Access Control**: Enforcing access control policies for sensitive operations or data.
    - **Caching**: Caching the results of expensive computations or database queries.
    - **Logging and Monitoring**: Logging method calls or monitoring the behavior of objects.
    - **Remote Access**: Providing a local representation of remote objects in distributed systems.

4. **Commonly Used in Python**:

    - Yes, the Proxy pattern is commonly used in Python, especially in situations where lazy initialization, access control, or additional functionality around objects is required. Python's flexibility and support for object-oriented programming make it well-suited for implementing the Proxy pattern.

5. **Alternative Patterns**:

    - **Decorator Pattern**: Decorators provide a flexible alternative to proxies for adding additional functionality to objects. They allow you to dynamically add behavior to objects without altering their interface.
    - **Adapter Pattern**: Adapters are used to provide a different interface to an object, making it compatible with a client's requirements. While proxies control access to an object, adapters provide a different interface.
    - **Facade Pattern**: Facade provides a simplified interface to a complex subsystem. While proxies often control access to individual methods or operations of an object, facades provide a higher-level interface to an entire subsystem.
