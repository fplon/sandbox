The Bridge pattern is a structural design pattern that decouples an abstraction from its implementation so that they can vary independently. **This pattern is useful when you have multiple implementations of an abstraction and want to avoid a permanent binding between the abstraction and its implementation.** Here are the advantages, disadvantages, alternative approaches, common use cases, and example code in Python with type annotations relating to quant finance.

Advantages of using the Bridge pattern:
Decoupling: It separates the abstraction from its implementation, allowing changes in one without affecting the other.
Flexibility: It enables you to create new implementations of an abstraction without modifying the client code.
Promotes code reusability: Both the abstraction and its implementations can be reused independently.

Disadvantages of using the Bridge pattern:
Complexity: Implementing the Bridge pattern can introduce additional complexity, especially for small-scale projects.
Overhead: There might be a slight performance overhead due to the added layers of abstraction.
Potential over-engineering: For simple scenarios, applying the Bridge pattern might be unnecessary and can lead to over-engineering.

Alternative approaches:
Inheritance: Instead of using composition as in the Bridge pattern, you can use inheritance to achieve similar goals.
Strategy pattern: It allows you to define a family of algorithms, encapsulate each one, and make them interchangeable.

Common use cases for Bridge pattern:
Database drivers: When creating an application that interacts with multiple databases, the Bridge pattern can be used to separate the database abstraction from its implementation.
User interface toolkit: It can be applied in UI toolkits where the abstraction represents different UI components and the implementations represent various platforms (e.g., web, desktop, mobile).
Quantitative finance: In quantitative finance applications, the Bridge pattern can be used to separate financial instrument abstractions from pricing algorithms.
